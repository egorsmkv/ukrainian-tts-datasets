Audio files cut off?


Some audio files appear to have been cut off. For example: `accept/64926.ogg` in the `tetiana` dataset (original text is "Уве́чері при ля́мпі ми сиді́ли в кімна́ті вчи́теля і розмовля́ли.").

I'm working on a tool to flag files that might not match the text by assuming speakers maintain a fairly consistent speaking rate. I'll post more here when I get results, but was curious if anyone else had seen this.

It was done faster than I expected! Here are the files flagged for each speaker: [ukrainian-tts_filtered.json.zip](https://github.com/egorsmkv/ukrainian-tts-datasets/files/11467466/ukrainian-tts_filtered.json.zip)

Here is the way this tool works ([source code here](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper/blob/v0.1.0/src/python/piper_train/filter_utterances.py)):

1. Punctuation is removed from text
2. Silence is removed from audio (using [silero vad](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-vad))
3. The speaking rate is calculated as `len(text) / duration_sec` for each audio file (characters per second)
4. Outliers are found in a similar manner to [this article](https://hersanyagci.medium.com/detecting-and-handling-outliers-with-pandas-7adbfcd5cad8) -- basically any file with a speaking rate far above/below the average

Based on the tool, there were:

* 563/6962 files flagged for lada
* 725/6977 files flagged for mykyta
* 230/5417 files flagged for tetiana

Should still be enough data to train with, but it might be good for humans to review those files :)
